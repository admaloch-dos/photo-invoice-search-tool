<h1>Photo Invoice Search Tool</h1>

<h2>About this Project:</h2>
<p>This is a Windows batch tool designed to streamline the file locating and copying process for invoice orders in the photo lab at Florida Memory. This tool is specifically built to assist in locating files for invoice orders, copying them over, taking note of files that are not yet uploaded, and maintaining accurate records of each processed order. This tool saves valuable time and increases efficiency for the staff.</p>

<h2>Features:</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Easy Input: The tool allows the staff to input an invoice order or a list of photo item IDs.</li>
  <li>Efficient Search: It can search a large directory filled with subdirectories for any file that contains any of the listed file IDs in the file name.</li>
  <li>File Management: If the files are located, the tool creates a new timestamped directory and copies them over.</li>
  <li>Error Handling: If any files are not successfully located, the tool creates a document listing those files.</li>
  <li>Managing records: Once the process is complete, relevant information about the search is logged to a spreadsheet.</li>
  <li>Time-Saving: This tool can finish a large invoice order in minutes, saving up to an hour per order.</li>
  <li>Improved Accuracy: The tool ensures that all requested files are located and copied correctly, minimizing errors and ensuring accurate records.</li>
  <li>Customizable: The tool was built with adaptability in mind and can easily be repurposed to work with other data sets.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Challenges:</h2>
<p>This project proved to be more complex than we initially anticipated so overcoming the limited features of the command prompt ended up being the greatest challenge. While more robust alternatives exist that might have been better suited for this project's needs, we made the most of the resources available to us and ultimately accomplished the task successfully.</p>

<h2>Takeaways:</h2>
<p>Building this command prompt tool was a challenging yet rewarding experience. It was my first foray into creating a tool of this nature, and it provided valuable learning opportunities. The tool has proven to be highly useful, with a demonstrable increase in efficiency for the photo lab staff.</p>
