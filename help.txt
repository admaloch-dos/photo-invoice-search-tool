Open the invoice-data.txt file and add the order information you want to search. You can either paste in an entire invoice order form, or search for a predefined list of items.


How to search with an invoice:
Open an invoice pdf file.
Select (ctrl a) then copy (ctrl c) the contents of the invoice.
Paste (ctrl v) the copied invoice into the invoice-data.txt file.
Save the file.
Locate the Photo-Search.bat file and double click to begin the process.


How to search with a list of items:
Make sure to include the invoice number and format it like this: Invoice #12345.
Paste in a list of items and make sure there is one item per line.
Save the file.
Locate the Photo-Search.bat file and double click to begin the process.

Anything can be searched and will be copied over as long as it is located as part of a file name anywhere in the Photo Masters folder.

File transfer process:
Once you double click the Photo-Search.bat file, a window will open that will show information about the status of the transfer and will display a message when complete. If there are any issues, the window will display a message letting you know what the problem is and how to fix it. Closing out of the window prior to completion will cancel the transfer.


Accessing the results:
A folder with the invoice # and a time stamp will be created in the transfer-results folder. Inside this folder there will be a new folder called copied_images that will contain the images that were successfully located. There will be another file called not-on-cloud.txt that will have a list of the items that were not successfully located on the cloud.
